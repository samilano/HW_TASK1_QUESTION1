Hostelworld - Task 1 - Question 1

Question 1: Given two strings, check if they’re anagrams or not

Two strings are anagrams if they are written using the same exact letters. For example, ‘Eleven plus two’ and ‘Twelve plus one’ are meaningful anagrams of each other.

Using the least amount of code, prove if the following are anagrams of each other:
1) Punishment —> Nine Thumps
2) The Morse code — > Here come dots
3) Snooze alarms —> Alas! No more Zs
4) Halley's Comet —> Shall yet come
5) One good turn deserves another. —> Do rogues endorse that? No, never!
